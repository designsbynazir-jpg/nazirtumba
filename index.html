    <p>
       Hi! My name is Nazir Johannes Tumba, from Adamawa State, Nigeria, and I currently reside in Lagos. I am a freelance creative professional with several years of experience in 3D animation and graphic design, driven by a passion for visual storytelling and creating realistic, meaningful digital content. I am purposeful, disciplined, and God-fearing, with a strong desire to grow both personally and professionally while making a positive impact through my work. I enjoy bringing ideas to life in ways that communicate emotion, clarity, and meaning, and I value working alongside others to learn, share ideas, and create positive outcomes together. This is my first HTML webpage, and I am excited to continue learning and developing my skills.
